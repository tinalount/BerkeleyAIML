### Data Overview: 
The data used for this project is a "vehicles.csv" data file, with 426,880 rows and 18 columns provided of used car sales data.


### Data Cleanup & Transformation Summary:
-- The original file has an extraordinary ampount of null values so a lot of work was done assessing which columns and rows to drop based on the lack of full data
-- The dataset was reduced down FROM 426,880 rows and 18 columns TO 124836 entries and 66 columns (only 1/4 of the data was kept for this quick first analysis)
-- Color, Manufacturer, Fuel and Type were onehotencoded 
-- Transmission was encoded into a boolean

### Data Transformation Details: 
Columns kept but transformed or encoded
----- PRICE: 32,895 rows with $0 'price' values were dropped from dataset
----- ODOMETER: 32,895 rows with $0 'odometer' values were dropped from dataset not knowing if this was trustworthy reading
----- COLOR:  Most of the used cars in the dataset were white, followed black,then silver, blue, red, and grey - this columnn was one-hot-encoded
----- YEAR--> AGE: The Year Column was converted into an Age column as an integer age with the most used car sales being for Ages 5-10 (this corresponds with a quick internet search that said 
 "Overall, researchers find that the average age of used cars people are seeking is 6.47 years old."
----- MANUFACTURER: this column was one-hot-encoded for the top 24 manufadturers that had over 1000 sales
----- CONDITION: this was kept with the null values dropped and then converted to a numeric mapping of 1 for new, 2 for excellent, 3 for like new, 4 for good, 5 for fair, 6 for salvage
----- CYLINDERS: converted into an integer column matching the # of cylinders and null rows were dropped
----- FUEL: one hot encoded into distinguishing between diesel, electric, gas, hybrid, and other 
----- TRANSMISSION: was simple encoded into a boolean 0 for automatic, 1 for other/manual/null
----- TYPE: one hot encoded to keep the overall kind of car the user is buying 

Dropped these columns: 
----- SIZE:  drop the column 'size' for this analysis since the model will effectively capture this by taking into account 'manufacturer'
----- MODEL: the 'model' column was too noisy and was dropped
----- REGION: the 'region' column was dropped due to 404 different values and inconsistent naming, etc
----- TITLE STATUS:dropped the 'title_status' column since it's captured by 'condition' 
----- DRIVE:dropped   since it's captured by 'type'

### Correlation Map: 
-- the correlation maps did not seem to show much correlation between the price column and the other columns which was a bit of a red flag indicating that revisiting the feature selection step might be required

### Visualizations:

### Modeling & Feature Selection: 
--- A baseline Linear Regression was run with all the variables and the coefficients were analyzed and ranked to understand which variables had a strong 1:1 
correlation with the Price variable - see plot: https://github.com/tinalount/BerkeleyAIML/blob/main/UsedCarSalesAnalysis/base_coef_plot.jpg - the first 20 
variables have the strongest correlation with 'price'
--- The data was split into a training set (70% of the data) and a test set (30% of the data)
--- A Baseline MSE was calculated for the dataset to be compared against various models
--- A Linear Regression was run against ALL the variables and the MSE calculated for the test data 
--- A Simple Linear Regression was run against ONLY ONE variable ('Type - pickup') that had the highest correlation coefficient 
--- A Lasso Grid Search Regression was run 
--- Sequential Feature Selection was used with a Linear Regression and 15 variables 

Baseline MSE for testing data:                   502973780564.00995

### Findings/TakeAways: 
--- The sale of used PickUp trucks seem to strongly affect the 'price' - so definitely focus on acquiring pickup trucks for the inventory
--- Regression coefficients indicate the strength and direction of the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable 
in a linear regression model. Specifically, they indicate the amount of change in the dependent variable (i.e., the predicted outcome) associated 
with a one-unit change in the independent variable while holding all other variables constant. Seems like the strongest relationship between the 
variable and price is for the odometer reading, the colors black, blue, brown, custom, green, grey, orange, purple, red, sliver, white and yellow, 
and the age of the car. 
--- Key Drivers of Used Car Sales: 
DISTANCE DRIVEN ('odometer'), 
CAR COLOR (with blue winning and black losing) 
CAR AGE:derived from the year, customer care about how old the car is and how much life is left in it.    Most customers are comfortable buying 5-6 year old cars.
MANUFACTURER: From a manufacturing perspective, the audis win out and the acuras have a negative relationship with car price.

### Recommendations: 
--- Stock up on pickup trucks
--- Paint cars blue!!! They sell for more! Don't buy black cars as they tend to sell for less (negative correlation with price)
--- Look for cars with low odometer mileage
--- Look for 5-6 year old cars - customers are seemingly not as interested in buying 2-3 year old cars 
--- Buy Audis (not Acuras)

### Next Steps:
-- This was just a first pass at trying to see if there was any predictive nature to the used car dataset 
-- The next phase would be to go back and try to clean up the data more and add the missing null values or impute them based on industry knowledge
-- Additional versions of feature selection might be tried since some assumptions were made that industry experts might not agree with on which to drop
