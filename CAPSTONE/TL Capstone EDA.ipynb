Not all high schoolers will go on to continued success.  Is this a matter of their collegiate academic pressures? their changing interests and expanded horizons that college environment affords? Does the level of training or over-training in high school determine if they still have room for development in college?  \n",

    "\n",
    "Question: Is there a correlation or trend between where the athlete went to HS and College and whether that athlete will continue to develop/improve in their main (2) events? Do some high schools just create superstar runners? Do some colleges create superstar runners? Are there any factors that make it more likely to have a full HS/Collegiate running career? Prediction for who might go pro?"
